LaPhs: Live Photos on the Web
======================

Add support for Apple's Live Photos in web browsers.

## Installation

### Using npm

Install the library:

    npm install --save laphs

Include it into your module:

```js
var LivePhotos = require('laphs');
```

### The old-fashioned way

Copy `dist/live-photos.min.js` into your project and include it in a `<script>` tag on your page. This will make the `LivePhotos` global variable available.

## Usage

[Full documentation](https://tumblr.github.io/laphs)

The easiest way to use this library is by using special data-attributes on your Live Photo `<img>` tags.

```html
<img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/3613923b93c21e78bc9e8935220c186a/tumblr_o63c4ekE1X1twn7m0o1_1280.jpg" data-live-photo="http://53.media.tumblr.com/3613923b93c21e78bc9e8935220c186a/tumblr_o63c4ekE1X1twn7m0o1.mov" data-live-photo-still-image-time="1.71"/>
```

* `src` is the URL of the keyframe image
* `data-live-photo` is the URL of the Live Photo video file
* `data-live-photo-still-image-time` is the time (in seconds) corresponding to where they keyframe was pulled from the video

Include this JavaScript to find and convert all such images that it finds on the page:

```js
LivePhotos.initialize();
```

You can also pass elements or custom selectors manually, if you prefer:

```js
LivePhotos.initialize(el);
// or...
LivePhotos.initialize([el1, el2, el3]);
// or...
LivePhotos.initialize('.my-live-photos');
```

The `LivePhotos` function returns an array of `LivePhoto` objects, which are described in more detail below.

By default, this library injects styles to make your Live Photos look nice. If you prefer, you can disable this behavior before you scan for Live Photos:

```js
LivePhotos.noStyles();
// Subsequent calls will not inject the styles
```

### The LivePhoto Object

Live Photos created using this library are wrapped in a `LivePhoto` object that has an API for playback

The following methods are available on Live Photos:

* `load` triggers loading the video assets for the Live Photo
* `play` activates Live Photo playback, stopping on the last frmae
* `stop` deactivates Live Photo playback, transitioning back to the keyframe
* `preview` plays a short clip of the video just before the keyframe, which mimicking the behavior of Live Photos viewed in the Photos App on an iOS device

If you like, you can create a `LivePhoto` object directly by passing an element with `src`, `data-live-photo`, and `data-live-photo-still-image-time` attributes:

```js
var livePhoto = new LivePhotos.LivePhoto(el, options);
```

You may also pass the keyframe and video URLs and the keyframe time directly:

```js
var livePhoto = new LivePhotos.LivePhoto(keyframeUrl, videoUrl, stillImageTime, options);
```
